          When most people think of making money from NFTs (non-fungible
          tokens), they usually imagine trading. That means buying an NFT at a
          low price and hoping to sell it at a higher price later on.

        <p className="md:mt-5 mt-3 md:text-xl md:mx-10">
          But what if your NFTs don’t increase in price over time? Then your
          money is stuck when it could be earning a return elsewhere.
          Thankfully, there’s a new way to earn passive income by staking NFTs.

          NFTs are a part of. Different NFTs will offer different staking
          rewards, and some NFTs aren't able to be staked at all.
